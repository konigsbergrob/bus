<h3> Robert Konigsberg's Real Time Bus Tracking Exercise :smile:</h3>

This repository will be used to showcase a project I completed  
during my enrollment in MIT xPRO's Professional Certificate in Coding:  
**Full Stack Development with MERN program.** :sunglasses:

**Name:** Eyes Exercise

**Description:** This was completed as part of week 9 of the program. The intention is to showcase my ability to fetch public data, and perform necessary operations in real time to reflect information to the user. In this program, I'm able to receive data about Boston's public transport buses. I fetch new data every 15 seconds, and the map on the screen adds markers given the most recently location. There's also functionality showcasing the different places I've traveled. For button #2, make sure to zoom into the Boston area to see it correctly. 

**Roadmap for Future Improvements:** I plan to separate both maps, so the starting points and zoom of the markers can be different (no zooming required depending on the button chosen). I also plan to update the look of the markers (e.g. make them look like buses instead of pins).


**Usage:** This can be used to help educate beginners about the fundamentals of web development. Albeit simple, it contains many fundamental building blocks used when coding.
